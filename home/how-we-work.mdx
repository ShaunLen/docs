## High-level approach

<Info>
We optimise for **long-lived projects** and **shared ownership**.
</Info>

That means we prefer:

| We prefer... | Over... |
|--------------|---------|
| Clear, maintainable solutions | Clever ones |
| Systems that scale | Quick hacks |
| Decisions that reduce future friction | Short-term speed |

<Note>
We assume contributors are experienced developers and trust them to make good technical decisions. This describes the *shape* of how we work, not a rigid rulebook.
</Note>

## Shared responsibility

<Warning>
There is no "my system, your system" — all code is **team-owned**.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Own the code collectively">
    Improvements to shared code, especially CoreLib, are encouraged from everyone.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix issues proactively">
    If you spot an issue that will affect future work, it's worth fixing properly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Communicate early">
    Changes that affect multiple projects should be discussed before implementation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## CoreLib-first mindset

CoreLib exists to absorb complexity so individual games don't have to.

When working on gameplay features, ask:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Reusable?" icon="recycle">
    Is this something we'll need again?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared system?" icon="cubes">
    Does this belong in a shared system?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Future benefit?" icon="forward">
    Would future projects benefit from generalisation?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If the answer is "yes", the preferred approach is:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Improve or extend CoreLib">
    Add or enhance shared functionality
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document the change">
    Update this wiki with the new capability
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep game code thin">
    Game-specific code should compose shared systems, not reimplement them
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Not everything belongs in CoreLib — but repeated patterns often do.
</Tip>

## Editor-first workflows

We strongly prefer **authoring and validation in the editor** rather than in code or data files.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Should have tooling">
    - Configuration
    - Tuning values
    - Content authoring
    - State inspection
    - Debug views
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Benefits">
    - Reduces runtime errors
    - Speeds up iteration
    - Makes systems understandable
    - Enables non-programmers to contribute
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Iteration and refactoring

<Info>
Refactoring is a normal and expected part of development.
</Info>

| Type | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **Small refactors** | Happen opportunistically |
| **Large refactors** | Planned and communicated |
| **Breaking changes** | Acceptable if they meaningfully improve clarity or correctness |

The goal is not to avoid change, but to make change **safe and intentional**.

## Communication and decisions

When making architectural decisions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write things down" icon="pen">
    Prefer documentation over tribal knowledge. Future you (and your teammates) will thank you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Capture the 'why'" icon="circle-question">
    Record why a decision was made, not just what was done. Context matters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep discussion close to code" icon="code-branch">
    Use PRs, issues, and this wiki. Slack messages disappear; documentation persists.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Quality bar

Code is expected to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Readable" icon="eye">
    Understandable without extensive explanation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fail loudly" icon="bell">
    Clear errors in development builds
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validated" icon="check">
    Include validation and debug tooling
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent" icon="equals">
    Follow Handbook conventions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
We don't aim for perfection, but we do aim for consistency.
</Note>

## In practice

Day-to-day, this means:

| Activity | Investment |
|----------|-----------|
| Structure and APIs | Time upfront |
| Tooling | When it reduces long-term cost |
| Gameplay code | Keep simple by using shared systems |
| Existing systems | Revisit and improve as requirements evolve |

<Tip>
This approach trades short-term speed for long-term leverage — and that trade-off is intentional.
</Tip>
