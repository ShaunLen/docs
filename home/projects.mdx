## Overview

Northbound builds **games**, supported by a small number of **shared libraries**.

Projects are expected to be long-lived and evolve over time. Shared infrastructure exists to reduce duplication, enforce consistency, and make it easier to move improvements between projects.

This page provides a high-level view of what exists today and how projects relate to each other.

## Shared libraries

### CoreLib

**CoreLib** is the primary shared library used across Northbound projects.

It provides:

- foundational runtime systems (input, interactions, state, data)
- editor tooling and authoring workflows
- opinionated architectural patterns

CoreLib is versioned and reused across projects rather than forked.\
Improvements made for one game are expected to benefit others where possible.

See the **CoreLib** section of this wiki for details.

---

## Games

Northbound games are built **on top of CoreLib**, not alongside it.

Each game typically contains:

- game-specific logic and rules
- content and tuning
- composition of shared systems
- presentation (UI, effects, audio)

Games should avoid reimplementing:

- infrastructure
- generic systems
- editor tooling that already exists in CoreLib

If a game requires functionality that feels broadly useful, it’s usually a sign that CoreLib should be extended.

> This keeps individual projects focused and prevents long-term divergence.

## Project boundaries

As a general rule:

- **CoreLib**
  - owns reusable systems
  - owns editor tooling
  - sets architectural conventions
- **Game projects**
  - own gameplay rules and content
  - decide how systems are composed
  - do not own shared infrastructure

Blurring these boundaries ~~is punishable by death~~ makes future reuse and maintenance harder.

---

## Adding a new project

When starting a new game:

- CoreLib should be treated as a required dependency with optional modules
- project structure should follow existing conventions
- any deviations should be intentional and documented

Early investment in structure and tooling pays off quickly as projects grow.

---

## Evolving projects

Projects are expected to change over time.

As requirements evolve:

- shared patterns should be identified
- systems should be improved rather than copied
- documentation should be updated alongside code

The goal is not to freeze architecture, but to keep it **coherent** as it evolves.

## Keeping this page up to date

This page intentionally avoids deep detail.

If you add:

- a new shared library
- a major new game project
- a significant change in how projects are structured

…update this page to reflect that reality.

It should always provide an accurate, high-level snapshot of Northbound’s ecosystem.
