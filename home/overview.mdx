## Northbound at a glance

Northbound builds games with a strong emphasis on **shared systems**, **clean architecture**, and **editor-first workflows**.

Rather than solving the same problems differently in every project, we invest heavily in:
- reusable core systems
- strong internal tooling
- clear conventions and guardrails

This allows individual games to stay focused on **gameplay and content**, not infrastructure.

---

## CoreLib at the centre

At the heart of our projects is **CoreLib** — a shared library that provides:
- foundational runtime systems (input, interactions, state, data)
- robust editor tooling built on top of s&box conventions
- opinionated patterns that reduce accidental complexity

CoreLib is **not** meant to be a general-purpose framework or engine replacement.  
It exists to solve *our* recurring problems in a consistent, maintainable way.

Games are expected to:
- depend on CoreLib
- extend it where appropriate
- avoid modifying it directly unless improving it for all projects

## Our design philosophy

A few high-level ideas inform most technical decisions at Northbound:

- **Editor-first**  
  If a system benefits from authoring or inspection, it should have proper editor tooling.

- **Clean APIs over convenience**  
  We are happy to do more work inside the library to keep usage simple and explicit.

- **Data vs behaviour**  
  Data is authored and validated; behaviour lives in code. Mixing the two is avoided where possible.

- **Server-authoritative by default**  
  Especially for gameplay-affecting systems.

- **Build on s&box, don’t fight it**  
  CoreLib extends and standardises s&box patterns rather than replacing them.

These principles are expanded on in the **Handbook**.

## How projects are structured

Most Northbound projects follow the same high-level shape:

- **CoreLib**  
  Shared systems and editor tooling.

- **Third-party libraries**  
  Existing libraries that compliment CoreLib, occasionally modified.

- **Game code**  
  Thin, game-specific logic:
  - content
  - composition
  - rules
  - presentation

- **Editor extensions**  
  Where needed, built on top of CoreLib’s Workbench and tooling patterns.

This separation helps keep projects scalable and makes it easier to move improvements “up” into shared code.

## How to use this wiki

Use this wiki as a **source of truth** for:
- how CoreLib systems are intended to be used
- which patterns are encouraged or discouraged
- how we integrate third-party libraries
- why certain architectural decisions were made

If something feels unclear, inconsistent, or undocumented — that’s a signal the wiki should be updated.

## Next steps

If you’re getting started:
- Read the **Engineering Pillars** in the Handbook
- Skim the **CoreLib Architecture** page
- Dive into the specific CoreLib systems relevant to your work

This should give you enough context to work confidently within Northbound’s codebases.
