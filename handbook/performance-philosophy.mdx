## Purpose

This document describes **how we think about performance**, not a checklist of optimisations.

Performance work is most effective when it is:
- intentional
- measured
- aligned with real constraints

Premature or speculative optimisation often increases complexity without meaningful benefit.

---

## Correctness and clarity first

A system must be:
1. correct
2. understandable
3. observable

…before it is fast.

Optimising unclear or poorly structured code tends to lock in bad designs and makes future changes harder.

---

## Measure before optimising

We do not optimise based on intuition alone.

Before investing in performance work:
- identify the actual bottleneck
- confirm it is measurable and repeatable
- understand its impact on gameplay or tooling

If something is not measurably slow, it is probably not worth optimising yet.

---

## Optimise where it matters

Not all code paths are equal.

We focus performance effort on:
- hot runtime paths
- per-frame logic
- systems that scale with player count or world complexity

Cold paths, editor-only code, and one-off setup costs are rarely worth aggressive optimisation.

---

## Performance as a system concern

Performance is often a consequence of **architecture**, not individual lines of code.

Good performance tends to emerge from:
- clear ownership of responsibilities
- predictable data flow
- minimal hidden work
- avoiding unnecessary coupling

Well-designed systems are easier to optimise when needed.

---

## Tooling and observability

Performance problems are easier to solve when systems are observable.

Where appropriate, systems should provide:
- debug visualisation
- logging hooks
- instrumentation points

This applies to editor tooling as well as runtime systems.

---

## Memory and allocation awareness

Unnecessary allocation in hot paths should be avoided.

We are mindful of:
- per-frame allocations
- large object churn
- hidden allocations in APIs

However, allocation avoidance should not come at the cost of readability unless profiling demonstrates a real issue.

---

## Server performance is critical

Server performance has a direct impact on:
- gameplay correctness
- scalability
- player experience

Server-side systems should be:
- predictable
- authoritative
- resistant to misuse

Client-side performance issues are often recoverable; server-side issues compound quickly.

---

## Optimisation is iterative

Performance work is rarely “done”.

Optimisation should:
- be incremental
- include validation and testing
- avoid large, risky rewrites unless clearly justified

Each optimisation should be understandable and reversible.

---

## Trade-offs are explicit

Every performance optimisation has a cost.

When making trade-offs, be explicit about:
- what is being gained
- what complexity is being introduced
- what flexibility is being lost

Undocumented trade-offs become future maintenance problems.

---

## Summary

At Northbound, performance is treated as:
- a design concern
- a measurement problem
- an ongoing process

We aim to build systems that are *naturally performant*, and only reach for aggressive optimisation when the data supports it.

If performance work feels urgent or unclear, that’s usually a sign the system needs better structure or observability first.
