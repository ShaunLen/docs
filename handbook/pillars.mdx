## What these pillars are

These pillars define **what we optimise for** when making technical decisions.

They are intentionally high-level.  
They do not describe workflows, processes, or step-by-step practices — those live elsewhere.

If a decision aligns with these pillars, it is usually a good one.  
If it violates them, it should do so intentionally.

## Longevity over immediacy

We optimise for systems that remain understandable and adaptable over time.

Short-term convenience should not compromise:
- clarity
- maintainability
- the ability to evolve without large rewrites

---

## Shared solutions over local fixes

When a problem appears more than once, it is a candidate for a shared solution.

We prefer:
- improving a shared system
- centralising complexity
- avoiding divergent implementations of the same idea

---

## Explicitness over magic

Systems should be understandable by reading the code.

We avoid:
- hidden behaviour
- implicit coupling
- configuration that meaningfully alters logic without visibility

Explicit systems are easier to debug, reason about, and change.

---

## Data clarity over flexibility

Data should describe *what exists*, not *how it behaves*.

Flexibility is valuable, but not when it obscures:
- intent
- ownership
- responsibility

Behaviour belongs in code.

---

## Authority over trust

When correctness matters, the system that enforces rules must be authoritative.

Client-side logic is for responsiveness and presentation, not truth.

---

## Composition over replacement

We extend existing engine and platform concepts rather than replacing them.

Building on established patterns reduces fragility and lowers the cost of future changes.

---

## Leverage over speed

We are willing to invest more effort upfront to reduce long-term cost.

Tooling, validation, and shared infrastructure are treated as multipliers, not overhead.

---

## Consistency over novelty

A consistent solution that fits existing patterns is preferred over a novel one.

Predictability reduces cognitive load and improves collaboration.

---

## Using these pillars

Use these pillars to:
- evaluate architectural proposals
- guide refactors
- resolve design disagreements

They describe *direction*, not *implementation*.
