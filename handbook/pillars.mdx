<Info>
These pillars define **what we optimise for** when making technical decisions. They are intentionally high-level.
</Info>

If a decision aligns with these pillars, it is usually a good one. If it violates them, it should do so **intentionally and with clear reasoning**.

## The pillars

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Longevity over immediacy" icon="hourglass-half">
    We optimise for systems that remain understandable and adaptable over time.

    Short-term convenience should not compromise:
    - Clarity
    - Maintainability
    - The ability to evolve without large rewrites

    **Ask:** Will this decision make sense in six months? Will it be easy to change?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shared solutions over local fixes" icon="cubes">
    When a problem appears more than once, it is a candidate for a shared solution.

    We prefer:
    - Improving a shared system
    - Centralising complexity
    - Avoiding divergent implementations of the same idea

    **Ask:** Has this problem been solved elsewhere? Should this solution be shared?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explicitness over magic" icon="eye">
    Systems should be understandable by reading the code.

    We avoid:
    - Hidden behaviour
    - Implicit coupling
    - Configuration that meaningfully alters logic without visibility

    **Ask:** Can someone understand this by reading the code? Are there hidden surprises?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data clarity over flexibility" icon="database">
    Data should describe *what exists*, not *how it behaves*.

    Flexibility is valuable, but not when it obscures:
    - Intent
    - Ownership
    - Responsibility

    Behaviour belongs in code.

    **Ask:** Is this data or is this behaviour? Are we mixing concerns?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authority over trust" icon="shield-halved">
    When correctness matters, the system that enforces rules must be authoritative.

    Client-side logic is for responsiveness and presentation, not truth.

    **Ask:** Who owns the truth here? Can this be exploited or desynchronised?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Composition over replacement" icon="puzzle-piece">
    We extend existing engine and platform concepts rather than replacing them.

    Building on established patterns reduces fragility and lowers the cost of future changes.

    **Ask:** Are we working with s&box or against it? Are we reinventing something that exists?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage over speed" icon="scale-balanced">
    We are willing to invest more effort upfront to reduce long-term cost.

    Tooling, validation, and shared infrastructure are treated as multipliers, not overhead.

    **Ask:** Will this investment pay off? Are we building leverage or just shipping faster?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consistency over novelty" icon="equals">
    A consistent solution that fits existing patterns is preferred over a novel one.

    Predictability reduces cognitive load and improves collaboration.

    **Ask:** Does this match how we do things elsewhere? Is the novelty justified?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

| Pillar | Optimise for | Avoid |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Longevity | Understandable, adaptable code | Short-term hacks |
| Shared solutions | Centralised, reusable systems | Duplicated implementations |
| Explicitness | Readable, obvious behaviour | Hidden magic |
| Data clarity | Clear data/behaviour separation | Mixed concerns |
| Authority | Server-authoritative truth | Client-side trust |
| Composition | Extension over replacement | Fighting the platform |
| Leverage | Upfront investment | Rushing without tooling |
| Consistency | Predictable patterns | Unnecessary novelty |

## Using these pillars

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Evaluate proposals">
    When reviewing architectural proposals, check each pillar:
    - Does this align with our values?
    - If it violates a pillar, is that intentional?
    - What's the reasoning?
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Guide refactors">
    When refactoring, use pillars as a compass:
    - Which pillar does this improve?
    - Are we moving toward or away from our ideals?
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Resolve disagreements">
    When design discussions stall:
    - Reference the pillars explicitly
    - Discuss which values are in tension
    - Make trade-offs intentionally
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
These pillars describe *direction*, not *implementation*. They inform decisions but don't dictate specific solutions.
</Note>
