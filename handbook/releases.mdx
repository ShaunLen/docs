  </Card>
  <Card title="Versioned" icon="tag">
    Releases have clear version numbers

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MAJOR">
    **Breaking changes**

    Increment when making incompatible API changes.

    ```
    1.0.0 → 2.0.0
    ```

    - Renamed public APIs
    - Removed functionality
    - Changed behaviour
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MINOR">
    **New features**

    Increment when adding backwards-compatible functionality.

    ```
    1.0.0 → 1.1.0
    ```

    - New systems
    - New APIs
    - New editor tools
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="PATCH">
    **Bug fixes**

    Increment for backwards-compatible bug fixes.

    ```
    1.0.0 → 1.0.1
    ```

    - Bug fixes
    - Performance improvements
    - Documentation updates
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Release branches

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "v1.0.0"
    commit
    commit
    branch release/1.1
    commit id: "prep 1.1"
    checkout main
    commit
    checkout release/1.1
    commit id: "v1.1.0" tag: "v1.1.0"
    checkout main
    merge release/1.1
    commit
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard release">
    Most releases come directly from main:

    1. Ensure main is stable
    2. Tag the release commit
    3. No release branch needed
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Release branch">
    Use when stabilisation is needed:

    1. Create `release/X.Y` from main
    2. Only bug fixes allowed
    3. Merge back to main after release
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Hotfix releases

<Warning>
Hotfixes are for critical issues only. Use standard releases for normal bug fixes.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify critical issue">
    Confirm the issue is severe enough for a hotfix
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create hotfix branch">
    Branch from the release tag

    ```bash
    git checkout v1.2.0
    git checkout -b hotfix/1.2.1
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix and test">
    Minimal changes to fix the issue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Release">
    Tag and release the hotfix

    ```bash
    git tag v1.2.1
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Forward port">
    Merge fix into main to prevent regression
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pre-release versions

For testing before stable release:

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Alpha | `X.Y.Z-alpha.N` | `2.0.0-alpha.1` |
| Beta | `X.Y.Z-beta.N` | `2.0.0-beta.3` |
| Release candidate | `X.Y.Z-rc.N` | `2.0.0-rc.1` |

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[alpha.1] --> B[alpha.2]
    B --> C[beta.1]
    C --> D[beta.2]
    D --> E[rc.1]
    E --> F[2.0.0]
```

<Note>
Pre-release versions are for internal testing. Don't depend on pre-release CoreLib versions in production game builds.
</Note>

### Handling breaking changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document clearly">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide migration guide">
    Help users update their code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consider deprecation">
    If possible, deprecate before removing

    public class InputContext { }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bump major version">
