## Core concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CoreLib" icon="cubes">
    Northbound's shared library providing foundational systems (input, interactions, state, definitions) and editor tooling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Definition" icon="file-code">
    A data object that describes game content. Authored in the editor, loaded at runtime. Examples: WeaponDefinition, ItemDefinition.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workbench" icon="wrench">
    CoreLib's framework for building editor applications with consistent UI, validation, and undo/redo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Working Copy" icon="copy">
    An editable copy of data used in editors. Changes are isolated until explicitly saved.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Input system

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Action** | A named player intent (e.g., "jump", "fire") independent of how it's triggered |
| **Binding** | The connection between a hardware input (key/button) and an action |
| **Context** | A collection of actions active during a game state (e.g., "gameplay", "menu") |
| **Composite** | Multiple inputs combined to produce a single value (e.g., WASD for movement) |
| **Modifier** | A transform applied to input (dead zone, scale, invert) |

---

## Interaction system

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Interactable** | An object that can be interacted with. Implements `IInteractable` |
| **Interaction Definition** | Data describing a type of interaction (range, type, priority) |
| **Interaction Provider** | Component that finds and manages available interactions |
| **Hold Interaction** | An interaction requiring sustained input for a duration |
| **Discovery** | The process of finding interactables within range |

---

## State & events

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Shared State** | Centralized, observable data that multiple systems access |
| **Event** | A typed message dispatched to notify systems of something happening |
| **Observer** | A pattern for reacting to state or property changes |
| **Event Bus** | The system that routes events to subscribers |

---

## Architecture

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Runtime** | Code that runs during gameplay (not editor-only) |
| **Editor** | Code that runs only during development in the editor |
| **Server-authoritative** | The server owns truth; clients predict and reconcile |
| **Validation** | Checking data for errors at authoring time |

---

## Data & authoring

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Stable ID** | A unique identifier that doesn't change (e.g., "weapon_pistol") |
| **Reference** | A link from one definition to another via stable ID |
| **Validation rule** | A check that ensures data meets requirements |
| **Migration** | Updating data when definition schemas change |

---

## Editor tooling

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Dock** | A panel in a Workbench application (hierarchy, inspector, preview) |
| **History** | The undo/redo stack tracking changes |
| **Command** | A recorded action that can be undone/redone |

---

## Networking

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Authority** | Who owns and can modify state (server or client) |
| **Prediction** | Client-side guessing of outcomes before server confirms |
| **Reconciliation** | Client adjusting state to match server's authoritative response |
| **Replication** | Server sending state to clients |

---

## Common abbreviations

| Abbreviation | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| **DPS** | Damage per second |
| **UI** | User interface |
| **RPC** | Remote procedure call |
| **ID** | Identifier |
| **API** | Application programming interface |
| **PR** | Pull request |

## Conventions

### "Definition" vs "Instance"

- **Definition:** The authored data template
- **Instance:** A runtime object created from a definition

```csharp
// Definition: authored data
var weaponDef = Definitions.Get<WeaponDefinition>("weapon_pistol");

// Instance: runtime object
var weapon = new Weapon(weaponDef);
```

### "System" vs "Manager"

We avoid "Manager" in favor of more descriptive names:

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| InputManager | InputSystem |
| PlayerManager | PlayerRegistry |
| EventManager | EventBus |
