## What is this wiki?

This is the internal knowledge base for **Northbound**.

Its purpose is to make it easy to:
- Understand and use **CoreLib**, our shared game framework
- Learn the **patterns and conventions** we use across projects
- Document how we integrate and wrap **third-party libraries**
- Capture engineering decisions so they don’t live only in people’s heads

All of our shared systems are designed to be **robust and opinionated internally**, while exposing **clean, minimal APIs** to game code.  
This wiki exists to explain *how* and *why* those systems work the way they do.

## How this wiki is organised

The navigation is split by **intent**, not by documentation type:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Handbook" icon="book">
    Engineering pillars, coding standards, architectural rules, and workflow.
    Read this to understand how we build and maintain long-lived projects.
  </Card>

  <Card title="CoreLib" icon="cubes">
    Documentation for CoreLib systems: Enhanced Input, interactions, state, definitions,
    and editor tooling. This is the primary reference for gameplay and tooling code.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Integrations" icon="plug">
    How Northbound uses third-party libraries (e.g. Facepunch GameEvents),
    including conventions, wrappers, and gotchas.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Reference" icon="list">
    Terminology, naming conventions, folder structure, and (eventually) API reference.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Where to start

If you’re new to a system or project, these are good entry points:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Engineering Pillars"
    icon="compass"
    href="/handbook/pillars"
  >
    The high-level rules and principles that guide how we write code and build systems.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="CoreLib Architecture"
    icon="diagram-project"
    href="/corelib/architecture"
  >
    How CoreLib is structured, including runtime vs editor code and core patterns.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Enhanced Input"
    icon="gamepad"
    href="/corelib/input/overview"
  >
    Our input system, how it works, and how to use it in gameplay code.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Editor Workbench"
    icon="wrench"
    href="/editor/workbench/overview"
  >
    The shared editor tooling framework that powers CoreLib editor apps.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## What this wiki is *not*

- It is **not** an s&box beginner guide  
- It is **not** a general C# tutorial  
- It is **not** a replacement for upstream documentation  

Instead, it focuses on **how *we* do things at Northbound**, and why.

When possible, we link to upstream docs rather than duplicating them.

---

## Keeping this useful

This wiki is a living document. If you:
- discover a recurring question
- make an architectural decision
- add or refactor a CoreLib system
- find a sharp edge in a third-party library

…document it here.

Clear docs are part of the engineering work, not an afterthought.
