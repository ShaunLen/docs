## How this wiki is organised

The navigation is split by **intent**, not by documentation type:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Handbook" icon="book">
    Engineering pillars, coding standards, architectural rules, and workflow practices.

    **Read this to understand:**
    - How we approach building long-lived projects
    - Our coding standards and conventions
    - Git workflow and release processes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CoreLib" icon="cubes">
    Documentation for all CoreLib systems: Enhanced Input, Interactions, State & Events, Definitions, and Editor Tooling.

    **This is your primary reference for:**
    - Gameplay system implementation
    - Editor tooling development
    - Data authoring workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integrations" icon="plug">
    How Northbound uses third-party libraries, including our wrappers, conventions, and gotchas.

    **Covers:**
    - Facepunch GameEvents integration
    - Other commonly used libraries
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reference" icon="list">
    Quick-reference material for terminology, naming conventions, and project structure.

    **Use for:**
    - Looking up standard terminology
    - Checking naming conventions
    - Understanding folder organisation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Where to start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the Engineering Pillars">
    Understand the high-level rules and principles that guide how we write code and build systems.

    <Card title="Engineering Pillars" icon="compass" href="/handbook/pillars" horizontal />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore CoreLib Architecture">
    Learn how CoreLib is structured, including runtime vs editor code and core patterns.

    <Card title="CoreLib Architecture" icon="diagram-project" href="/corelib/architecture" horizontal />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dive into specific systems">
    Pick the system most relevant to your current work and explore its documentation.

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Enhanced Input" icon="gamepad" href="/corelib/input/overview" />
      <Card title="Interactions" icon="hand-pointer" href="/corelib/interactions/overview" />
      <Card title="State & Events" icon="database" href="/corelib/state/overview" />
      <Card title="Editor Workbench" icon="wrench" href="/editor/workbench/overview" />
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What this wiki is *not*

<Warning>
This documentation assumes familiarity with s&box and C# development.
</Warning>

| This wiki is... | This wiki is not... |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Northbound-specific patterns | An s&box beginner guide |
| CoreLib system documentation | A general C# tutorial |
| Our conventions and decisions | A replacement for upstream docs |

When possible, we link to upstream documentation rather than duplicating it.

---

## Keeping this useful

<Tip>
Clear docs are part of the engineering work, not an afterthought.
</Tip>

If you:
- Discover a recurring question
- Make an architectural decision
- Add or refactor a CoreLib system
- Find a sharp edge in a third-party library

...document it here. This wiki is a living document that should evolve with our projects.
